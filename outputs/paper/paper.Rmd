abstract: "We often take our right to free education in Canada for granted while people in third world countries have to pay for education and often times realize they can do without one. In this data study I obtained a National Family Health
Survey from Pakistan, hosted by the Demographic and Health Surveys program in the US. I converted the education research table into a usable dataset which I analysed and visualized to observe changes in literacy rate over generations and provinces. In doing so I concluded that literacy rate in Pakistan has been on a steady incline but is rather slow, therefore there should be action taken to promote education for the development of the country."

# Introduction

I grew up in Pakistan, I know first hand how difficult it is to get an education there. Low earning family opt to have their children work labor jobs over giving them an education. Education is not free in Pakistan, schools are privately owned and so having to pay for school when families are already earning pennies is very difficult. When I saw the Pakistan Demographic and Health survey I wanted to see how the literacy rate has changed over the years and if the country is doing something about their low literacy rate.

I obtained the Demographic and Health survey and found a table about house hold education in Pakistan. I then had to understand how the table was recorded and organized. The table organized data by background characteristic which was separated into subgroups such as age groups, residence, and province. The table organized education for each background characteristic by education level; primary, middle, and secondary. The table also had records of the sample recorded for each characteristic. After I had an understanding of what data I had available to me I knew what I needed to do. I decided to create line graphs that would compare the generational literacy rate and calculate how fast literacy rate is increasing in Pakistan.

Using my data to analyze how the literacy rate has changed over the last 55+ years I noticed that literacy rate is on a steady incline in Pakistan. The percent of people falling in the "no education" category have decreased by ~20% when comparing males of ages 65+ and 10-14. I also decided to see how each province fairs on its own in terms of literacy rate, my models showed me that Balochistan had the lowest literacy rate over a ~20% difference from the other provinces. Looking at these stats its very important that Pakistan put more effort into increasing the literacy rate in Balochistan and make education more accessible for future generations.

# Data

I obtained my data from the **DHSProgram** [@citeNFHS] final report database, using the 'pdftools' package [@citepdftools] and the statistical programming language **R** [@citeR]. I used the **tidyverse** package for data cleaning and manipulation [@citetidyverse] and **kableExtra** for table formatting [@citekableExtra]. The header includes two lines of code **"usepackage{float}"** which allows the use of float in our R markdown and the line **"floatplacement{figure}{H}"** [@citeholdposition] which keeps the tables and figures locked in the specific place where they are written in R markdown.

This data set contains the highest level of education achieved for every age group, residence and province. Education level is classified into four categories; no education, primary, middle, and secondary+. Age groups are organized from 5-9 to 65+ years of age, each age group being a group of 5 years. Residence is organized as either total urban, major city, other urban, or rural. Finally provinces are classified as Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan. 

The data we are interested in is average level of education for each age group and average level of education for each province. I will look for any patterns that show progress in education in each age group. We also want to see if any province has lower literacy rate than expected and how this concerns the countries literacy rate. 

(Tables \@ref(tab:maleeducation) and \@ref(tab:femaleeducation)) show the cleaned data organized by gender.

```{r maleeducation, echo= FALSE}
# Read the data into a variable
male_education <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/inputs/data/males_data.csv")
# Filter the data to be specific to Agincourt North neighborhoods and to exclude source of infections that contain "No Information" or "Pending"
male_education |> 
  select(Background.Characteristic, No.Education, Primary, Middle, Secondary.) |>
# Include 10 listings in the table
  slice(1:10) |> 
# Display the table with a caption and appropriate column names and format properties
  kable(
    caption = "Literacy Rate Data For Males",
    col.names = c("Background Characteristic", "No Education", "Primary", "Middle", "Secondary+"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "") |> 
    kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```
```{r femaleeducation, echo= FALSE}
# Read the data into a variable
female_education <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/inputs/data/females_data.csv")
# Filter the data to be specific to Agincourt North neighborhoods and to exclude source of infections that contain "No Information" or "Pending"
female_education |> 
  select(Background.Characteristic, No.Education, Primary, Middle, Secondary.) |>
# Include 10 listings in the table
  slice(1:10) |> 
# Display the table with a caption and appropriate column names and format properties
  kable(
    caption = "Literacy Rate Data For Females",
    col.names = c("Background Characteristic", "No Education", "Primary", "Middle", "Secondary+"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "") |> 
    kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```



We can observe that our values for each education level are organized in decimals, this represents the percentage of the population that completed this level of education. We want to ignore the first age group since ages of 5-9 would have no data available for education level above middle school. 

We want to see how the literacy rate in Pakistan has changed over the years. To do this I will visualize my data on a line graph comparing the literacy rate for each age group. This way I can compare how much the literacy rate has changed for each age group and continue doing this for each education level.

\newpage

# Results

I first filtered the unwanted rows, this included any rows that did not include age groups. From here I needed to graph one line for each education level, I graphed each line and associated it with a color, this way I could create a legend for all my lines. Now that I had my graph with lines for each education level, I labeled my X and Y axis and created my legend.

(Figure \@ref(fig:malegraph)) shows the generational literacy rate comparison for each education level for men.

```{r malegraph, fig.cap="Male Generational Literacy Rate", echo = FALSE}

male_education |>
  filter(Background.Characteristic != "Total Urban", Background.Characteristic != "Major city", Background.Characteristic != "Other urban", Background.Characteristic != "Rural", Background.Characteristic != "Punjab", Background.Characteristic != "Sindh", Background.Characteristic != "NWFP", Background.Characteristic != "Balochistan", Background.Characteristic != "Total", Background.Characteristic != "5-9") |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Background.Characteristic, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = No.Education, color = "No.Education"), color = "darkgreen")+
  geom_line(aes(y = Primary, color = "Primary"))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Middle, color = "Middle"))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Secondary., color = "Secondary."), color = "darkorange")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Age Group",
       y = "Population (Percentage)",
       color = "Education Indicator",
       caption = "Generational Literacy Rate Comparison") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Education Indicator", values = c("None" = "darkgreen", "Primary" = "darkred", "Middle" = "darkblue", "Seconday+" = "darkorange"))+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Our graph shows a steady decrease in percentage of people in the "no education" category, if we calculate this into rate of increase of literacy from the ages 10-14 to 65+ we can see how the rate of literacy in Pakistan is increasing every year. We can do this by first obtaining the values at our end points, our current "no education" rate for 10-14 years of age is 23.8% and for ages 65+ is 80.1%. From here we can take the difference and divide by the years passed. This would give us a 80.1-23.8 = 56.3, and we can divide this by the years passed which is 65-(10to15) = 50to55, dividing 56.3 by 50 and 55 we get an approximate 1.1% increase in education per year for the past 50-55 years in Pakistan.

\newpage

I now want to look at the difference in literacy rate in each province. For this I can just create a graph to visualize the percentage of the population in each province that falls under "no education". To do this I can first filter background characteristic so that I am only working with the provinces, from here I can plot the points for their values corresponding to each province.

(Figure \@ref(fig:malegraphregional)) shows the statistics for each province vs no education rate.

```{r malegraphregional, fig.cap="Male Regional Literacy Rate", echo= FALSE}
male_education |>
  filter(Background.Characteristic == "Punjab" | Background.Characteristic == "Sindh" | Background.Characteristic == "NWFP" | Background.Characteristic == "Balochistan") |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Background.Characteristic, y=No.Education)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple")+
  labs(x = "Province",
       y = "No Education Rate",
       caption = "Literacy Rate Comparison Between Provinces")

```

From (Figure \@ref(fig:malegraphregional)) we see a drastic difference in literacy rate between Balochistan and the other provinces. Balochistan seems to have the lowest literacy rate in Pakistan while the other provinces are in ~7% range of each other. 

Balochistan has been known as the most neglected province in Pakistan despite being the largest and a resource-rich area. Blochistan has been going through a number of issues including terrorism, poverty, and illiteracy. Education is one of the major issues that plays an important role in the social and economic spheres of a country and Balochistan has been neglected for years [@citeBalochistan]. Balochistan also has one of the lowest number of educational institutes for women in the world.

# Discussion

Using our findings from above we can conclude that the key areas for improvement in Pakistan's literacy rate are Balochistan and overall increase in access to education. Though the overall literacy rate in Pakistan is on a steady incline it is still far too slow at a 1.1% per year. As the literacy rate reaches higher percentages the increase will become smaller and progress will be slowed again. Pakistan needs to make education more accessible, whether that be providing free education or making affordable education options available. Education is necessary for a country's progress and educating the general public about general knowledge is the key to eliminating corruption that has overrun the country for decades. 

Rate of primary school education for ages 5-9 has peaked, doubling from prior age groups. This is a great sign for future education, since children attending primary school are more likely to continue their studies. Pakistan surprisingly has a higher population that is attending secondary+ education than middle school, this could be due to an interest in studies later in life, or maybe students are returning from abroad to study for their higher studies. I have personally seen this case from relatives that live abroad as its much easier to get into a medical school in Pakistan than in western countries. So families will come abroad to study up until the end of high school and then return to study in Pakistan past high school.

Balochistan is a big area of worry with its extremely low literacy rate. Balochistan has one of the lowest rate of literacy for women in the world, sitting at over 88% illiteracy rate. This is one of the biggest problems that need to be resolved, but truth be told, Pakistan has been run by corrupt officials for decades. The officials in Pakistan care more about making money and their reputation than making a difference in their country. Progress is slow, people are uneducated and uneducated people are less likely to understand the issues regarding politics and the needs for social and economic change in the country.

There isn't all bad news though. There are many well educated individuals in and outside the country that are trying to make a difference. People are studying abroad and taking their knowledge back to Pakistan and doing their best to educate the public. The public has become very hostile towards corruption and stand up to fight against it when they see it and this has been bringing the country on the incline over the years which we can see from our findings. In conclusion I think the future generation in Pakistan will be well educated and progress in the development in the country's social and economic sphere. Pakistan needs to make education affordable and provide education facilities in areas that are depraved of them. Balochistan is one of the main areas of concern that must be taken care of immediately, building small schools and providing education there would be a great way to start. I think in a 5-10 more years Pakistan can reach and even surpass the average literacy rate in the world.

	- The instances represent the background characteristic of the individials that were sampled, which were furthere classified into age groups, gender, area of residence, and province.
2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- There are 22 instances
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset does contain all possible instances.
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of 9 values which are as the percentage of the instance that falls under each category, the categories include: no education, primary school, middle school, secondary+ school, missing, total, number of persons, median years, mean years.
5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The first column of each instance corresponds to the state it represents, which is the label associated with it.
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- There is only 1 instance of missing information. In which case, the missing value is due to unavailable data. Namely, missing data due to ages 5-9 unable to attend middle school+

12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- Columns that might cause anxiety include: lack of education available to women, this is due to the fact that Pakistan is still a developing country and thus gender role stereotypes exist.
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset identifies sub-populations by age groups and gender. Male and female is data is completely seperated as the data is significantly different. Data for age groups is due to the availability of education for certain age groups.
