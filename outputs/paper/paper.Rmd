# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. For instance, Section \@ref(data). R Markdown automatically makes the sections lower case and adds a dash to spaces to generate labels, for instance, Section \@ref(first-discussion-point). 

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="The Table in the NFHS Final Report", out.width = '95%'}
include_graphics(here::here("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/outputs/materials/dh_surveymale.PNG"))
include_graphics(here::here("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/outputs/materials/dh_surveyfemale.PNG"))
```

# Data

Our data is of penguins (Figure \@ref(fig:maleeducation)).

```{r maleeducation, echo= FALSE}
# Read the data into a variable
male_education <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/inputs/data/males_data.csv")
# Filter the data to be specific to Agincourt North neighborhoods and to exclude source of infections that contain "No Information" or "Pending"
male_education |> 
  select(Background.Characteristic, No.Education, Primary, Middle, Secondary.) |>
# Include 10 listings in the table
  slice(1:10) |> 
# Display the table with a caption and appropriate column names and format properties
  kable(
    caption = "Literacy Rate Data For Males",
    col.names = c("Background Characteristic", "No Education", "Primary", "Middle", "Secondary"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "") |> 
    kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```
```{r femaleeducation, echo= FALSE}
# Read the data into a variable
female_education <- read.csv("/cloud/project/Issues-With-Education-In-Pakistan/inputs/data/females_data.csv")
# Filter the data to be specific to Agincourt North neighborhoods and to exclude source of infections that contain "No Information" or "Pending"
female_education |> 
  select(Background.Characteristic, No.Education, Primary, Middle, Secondary.) |>
# Include 10 listings in the table
  slice(1:10) |> 
# Display the table with a caption and appropriate column names and format properties
  kable(
    caption = "Literacy Rate Data For Females",
    col.names = c("Background Characteristic", "No Education", "Primary", "Middle", "Secondary"),
    digits = 1,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = "") |> 
    kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```



Talk more about it.

Also bills and their average (Figure \@ref(fig:malegraph)). (Notice how you can change the height and width so they don't take the whole page?)

```{r malegraph, fig.cap="Male Generational Literacy Rate", echo = FALSE}

male_education |>
  filter(Background.Characteristic != "Total Urban", Background.Characteristic != "Major city", Background.Characteristic != "Other urban", Background.Characteristic != "Rural", Background.Characteristic != "Punjab", Background.Characteristic != "Sindh", Background.Characteristic != "NWFP", Background.Characteristic != "Balochistan", Background.Characteristic != "Total", Background.Characteristic != "5-9") |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Background.Characteristic, group = 1)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = No.Education, color = "No.Education"), color = "darkgreen")+
  geom_line(aes(y = Primary, color = "Primary"))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Middle, color = "Middle"))+
  geom_line(aes(y = Secondary., color = "Secondary."), color = "darkblue")+
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "Age Group",
       y = "Education Rate",
       color = "Education Indicator",
       caption = "Generational Literacy Rate Comparison") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Education Indicator", values = c("None" = "darkgreen", "Primary" = "darkred", "Middle" = "darkblue", "Seconday+" = "darkorange"))+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

```{r malegraphregional, fig.cap="Male Generational Literacy Rate", echo = FALSE}

male_education |>
  filter(Background.Characteristic == "Punjab" | Background.Characteristic == "Sindh" | Background.Characteristic == "NWFP" | Background.Characteristic == "Balochistan") |>
  select(Background.Characteristic, No.Education) |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=Background.Characteristic, y=No.Education)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple")+
  labs(x = "Province",
       y = "Education Rate",
       caption = "Literacy Rate Comparison Between Provinces")
```

Talk way more about it.
